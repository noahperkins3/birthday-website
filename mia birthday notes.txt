mia birthday notes

Dear Mia,

Happy Birthday! And your 21st! I hope you have a wonderful day surrounded by all your special favorites. I learned that you love to write and like me, you love fantasy stories with strong female heroes. We always need more of those and I wish you all the best on your writing journey, whatever avenue it takes you down. Keep going and follow your dreams, however they may evolve.
Paviamma,

Dear Mia,
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY! 21!!! Wow, that’s so crazy.  I am really sad that I can’t come to San Diego and celebrate with you, but I know you are gonna still have an amazing day! You have been one of the chillest (and truest to yourself) people I have met and I am so proud to call you one of my best friends.  Seriously, no one is realer and more genuine of a friend than you and I really hope that even on days you don’t feel so hot, you know that you truly are an amazing human to your core! BUT! Today is going to be a great day for you I know, so live yo life and I hope you are doing whatever makes YOU happiest today. I love you and I can’t wait to see you again🫶🏼🫶🏼 Have a happy happy birthday mi!!! 21!!! Sending all the love - Ally

Mia!
Hey friend! I can’t believe you’re 21. It’s so weird to think that I’ve known you since I was 15. You’ve always made me feel so loved and so safe. I could not be more grateful to have someone like you to go through life with. You’ve literally seen me at my worst and made it known that I would be supported, no matter what. I have loved watching you become the beautiful baddie you are today. I knew you’d always achieve great things but it’s amazing to actually be able to watch it happen. You deserve all the great things coming your way. I hope 21 treats you right and you get to experience and adventure and feel so loved. I adore you. I love you. I appreciate you. Thank you for being you. And thank you for being one of my most favorite people on this entire planet (and she’s pretty fatty). Happy happy 21!
Love,
Claire Bear xoxo

Mia,
Happy birthday my lovely sister! You amaze me every day. From our bunk bed days to living countries away, you’ve always found a way to make me proud. You are clever and creative and brave. You shine! I am so lucky to have you in my life as a sister and friend. I wish I could be with you on your day but I am sending lots and lots of love!! 

Keep shining!
