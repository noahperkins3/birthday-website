mia birthday notes

Dear Mia,

Happy Birthday! And your 21st! I hope you have a wonderful day surrounded by all your special favorites. I learned that you love to write and like me, you love fantasy stories with strong female heroes. We always need more of those and I wish you all the best on your writing journey, whatever avenue it takes you down. Keep going and follow your dreams, however they may evolve.
Paviamma,

mia- happy birthday bestie! i can’t even begin to describe how much i appreciate you in my life. I’m so lucky to have met you and have you as a friend. You are such an amazing person and i hope you know how much of a positive impact you have on people’s life. I honestly look up to you, and you are such a role model to those around you. I miss you so much! Maybe i will have to visit you in california and i can swim in the ocean while you are like my cool mom sitting on the beach. Happy happy birthday!

Dear Mia,
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY! 21!!! Wow, that’s so crazy.  I am really sad that I can’t come to San Diego and celebrate with you, but I know you are gonna still have an amazing day! You have been one of the chillest (and truest to yourself) people I have met and I am so proud to call you one of my best friends.  Seriously, no one is realer and more genuine of a friend than you and I really hope that even on days you don’t feel so hot, you know that you truly are an amazing human to your core! BUT! Today is going to be a great day for you I know, so live yo life and I hope you are doing whatever makes YOU happiest today. I love you and I can’t wait to see you again🫶🏼🫶🏼 Have a happy happy birthday mi!!! 21!!! Sending all the love - Ally
